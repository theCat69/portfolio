  "aboutme": {
    "text": "I was born in Cannes in 1988 and grew up surrounded by the beautiful mountains and the mesmerizing sea. Basketball has been a significant part of my life for over a decade, and my love for the NBA still remains strong. During my late teenage years, I discovered my passion for playing the guitar, and even now, I continue to strum the strings for my own enjoyment (and sometimes for my neighbors' as well).",
    "para2": "My academic journey led me to the Nice University of Science, where I pursued a degree in chemistry. Following that, I furthered my education by completing my master's degree in Lyon. However, despite my efforts, I faced challenges in finding my place within the chemistry industry. This led me to embark on a new path and undergo training to become a full stack developer.",
    "para3": "Upon completing my training, I was fortunate enough to be recruited by Cap Gemini, a renowned French tech consulting company. For three years, I worked on various Java projects, gaining valuable experience and honing my skills. Subsequently, I was offered a position at Webhelp payment services, where I specialized in Java development.",
    "para4": "Currently, I am charting my own course as an independent full stack developer, eager to take on new opportunities and challenges. I am excited about the prospect of collaborating with you and working together towards our shared goals."
