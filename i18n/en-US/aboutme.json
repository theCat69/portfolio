  "aboutme": {
    "text": "Born in Cannes in 1988. I grew up between the mountains and the sea. I played basketball for more than 10 years and I am still a fan of the NBA. I learned guitar in my late teenage years and now I still play for myself (and my neighbors). I went to Nice university of science to study chemistry and I pursued my master in Lyon. After struggling to find my place in the chemistry industry I pursued a formation to be a full stack developer. At the end of the formation, I was recruited by Cap Gemini, a famous tech consulting French company. After 3 years working on different Java project I was recruited by Webhelp payment services to perform java development. Today, I am pursuing my own path as an independent full stack developer and I am looking forward for us working together."
