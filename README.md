# Portfolio

## TODO

- permit parallel E2E test on CI : attribute random unused port to rocket for E2E and use it in e2e test as well (env variables seems to do the trick but i need to check if cargo make env is shared or not)
- add a button to download my CV 
- make all translation and reread myself of mistakes
- add a menu to change the current used local
